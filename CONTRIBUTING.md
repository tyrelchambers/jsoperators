# What we're looking for
This repo will serve as a growing search tool for javascript operator searching. I'd love help expanding and improving this tool in terms of additional operators, improved descriptions of operators, or fun logical/UI additions.

## To Contribute

- Fork the repository
- Open a PR directed to our main branch

The more detailed a PR, the better! If you notice other things that could be fixed, open a separate PR for each scoped issue just so PRs don't get too large.
