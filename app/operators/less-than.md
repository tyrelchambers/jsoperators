The less than operator will check if one value is less than the other
and if it is, it'll return a **true** value.

This operator also works with strings and will evaluate each individual
letter in a word to it's corresponding letter in the other word.

```javascript
console.log(1 < 2); // true
console.log(2 < 1); // false
console.log("aa" < "ab"); // true
```
