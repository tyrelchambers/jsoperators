## Array 

The `Array` object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

In JavaScript, arrays aren't primitives but are instead `Array` objects with the following core characteristics:

- **JavaScript arrays are resizable** and **can contain a mix of different data types.** (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
- **JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays** and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
- **JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed:** the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
- **JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies.** (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

```javascript
// 'fruits' array created using array literal notation.
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana'];
console.log(fruits.length); // 2

// 'fruits2' array created using the Array() constructor.
const fruits2 = new Array('Apple', 'Banana');
console.log(fruits2.length); // 2

// 'fruits3' array created using String.prototype.split().
const fruits3 = 'Apple, Banana'.split(', ');
console.log(fruits3.length); // 2
```
