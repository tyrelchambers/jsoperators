The bitwise OR operator results in a 32-bit integer where each bit in
the numbers being ORed is set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits
are set to 1. If either number is different, that resulting bit will be
set to 0.

```javascript
console.log(2 | 2); // 2
console.log(2 | 3); // 3
console.log(2 | 4); // 6
```
