The bitwise shift right operator will shift the specified number of bits
to the right. In the example below, the left-hand 2 will have it's bits
shifted 2 bits to the right because the right-hand number is a 2. In the
second example, they will be shifted 3 bits.
Excess bits shifted to the right are discarded.
