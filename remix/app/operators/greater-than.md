The greater than operator will check if one value is greater than the
other and if it is, it'll return a **true** value.
This operator also works with strings and will evaluate each individual
letter in a word to it's corresponding letter in the other word.

```javascript
console.log(1 > 2); // false

console.log(2 > 1); // true
console.log("aa" > "ab"); // false
```
